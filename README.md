Git and Github are so misunderstood, and I’ve decided I’d like get to know them better. 

### First Impressions
Here were my initial impressions of them before I actually jumped into using them. 

Github’s website says Git and Github are easy to learn. They even say you can learn it without any code! What a *relief*!

Git reveals its greatest potential on the comand line, which is itself seemingly straightforward and unassuming. Sounds *powerful*!

GitHub has a simple website even more intuitive to navigate because of its graphical user interface. That seems *manageable*!

Git itself is a simple name made up of three simple letters. And Github has an adorable mascot, the Octocat.

__Git__ is a *Version Control System* and __GitHub__ is like Git with social networking. They’re there to help you build and collaborate on projects with peace of mind, and so naturally you’d get the impression that it’s supposed to be simple and easy to use. 

Looking into Octocat's adorable eyes, I honestly believed that Git and GitHub were a cute-appreciating, harmless pair that existed genuinely and only to make my life easy. 

But if that were the case, why do people panic when it's time to use them?

### How I Felt Abused by Git
For many reasons, I've had lots of internal freakouts whenever I've had to approach Git. The command line is simple, but obscure, not only for me but for many inexperienced users. When things go wrong, it screams at you with long lines of complex words. And when things go right, very, very little happens, if anything at all, and you don’t always get validation. The command line just accepts whatever you last entered and then wordlessly and apathetically moves on to the next line leaving you wondering whether you did the right thing or not! I don't know about you, but to me, that's reminiscent of a bad relationship.

Then we add Git and some people into the mix. Although the experience is not all that much different, it’s far more high-risk and terrifying.

### Why I Decided to Work On My Relationship With Git
Several of my bootcamp classmates and I learned the hard way after from our very first collaborative project experience last week that without trying to understand how Git works and establishing a good workflow on Git and Github, you will not only ruin your own efforts, projects, and experiences, but your relationships too.

Even though my project experience suffered, it was an arguably necessary experience because now I'm highly motivated to not repeat my mistakes. Because I now know what it’s like to collaborate on a project, I have a better idea about how to research solutions for my problems and I can read Git documentation with more clarity. I have a stronger sense (I think!) of how Git and Github can help me work more harmoniously with my team, and I think it's only right to share what I've learned so we can all better maintain and preserve our relationships.
